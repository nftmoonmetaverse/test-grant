- Project: NFT Moon Metaverse
- Team Name: NFT Moon Metaverse

### Overview

 NFT Moon Metaverse is the futuristic Create2Earn multi blockchain Metaverse. It will be inhabited by self-driven and creative people craving for boundless opportunities. NFT Moon is a metaverse in which a person can build a new life. The main task of the player is to make the planet alive. To do this, convenient constructors are given, where a person builds avatars, houses, objects, cities, countries. All interaction is based on Play2Earn and Create2Earn. The entire metaverse is built on [plots of land](https://landmint.nftmoon.space), [id card](https://moonopolis.nftmoon.space/), [DAO avatars](https://daomoonopolis.space/). The plot gives the following opportunities: to divide the land, to rent, to receive income from the metaverse, access to advanced designer features, access to rare avatars.
ID Cards grants the entrance to the Metaverse where each person can build a personalized reality and experience. Besides networking with other MoonWalkers , one has access to a variety of Metaverse assets: land plots, objects, avatars, advanced designer features. There are over 10 beneficial opportunities in NFT Moon Metaverse — from renting land to creating businesses and events. 

The owners of the plots form cities, which turn into DAOs.Communities can create their own economies.The first city in the metaverse is Moonopolis, which is formed by the board of management-owners of DAO avatars.

We are interested in expanding the blockchains that will be used in the metaverse. Now we use four main blockchains: Polygon, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Harmony.
Thanks to the bridge between blockchains, we will implement a bridge for the Secret Network. This will make it possible to move assets of the metaverse (land, ID card, avatars) from other blockchains to the Secret Network and in the opposite direction.
It will also enable holders of land, id cards, avatars to trade them on marketplaces that support Secret Network. We can also create a location with Secret Network, which will allow users to get more information about projects Secret Network.


Thus, we will create a trading path between different blockchains for NFT Moon Metaverse.

### Project Details

We have been developing NFT Moon Metaverse for a year now . During this time, we have a large audience, as well as buyers of land, id cards, avatars. Currently, work is underway on the alpha version and the addition of new blockchains to the NFT Moon Metaverse.

#### What will be done for the development of Secret Network.

1. A Smart Contract For Secret Network will be created (the bridge will do this)
2. Creating 15-25% of all types of NFT on Secret Network (via bridge. This is our assumption, since users decide for themselves which network they use)
3. Updating the Smart contract for the needs of the Metaverse
4. Launching a Metaverse on the Secret Network (after alpha is released)

This will give a new influx of users to Secret Network. After launching the metaverse, users will move between networks. Example: A user has a plot of land in the Polygon network, he transfers the plot to the Secret Network via a bridge, the sale takes place on the marketplace with the participation of Secret Network, then the user decides which network he will use next.

#### Mockups/Designs of any UI components

#### Problem / Solution

We give people maximum freedom in the metaverse. From choosing a blockchain to creating your own DAO and economy and games.One of the problems is using only one blockchain, which is inconvenient for the user. We offer a large number of blockchains for convenience. The bridge makes cross-chain Metaverse possible. It integrates Secret Network to the Metaverse ecosystem opening  possibilities of development and growth.
In our opinion, the built-in designers will allow people from small economies and poor countries to do work and receive money, as well as use the metaverse on any device from a phone to a game console. Most of the existing metaverses are focused on gamers and games and few people give people the opportunity to use in everyday life. We want people to use the metaverse in different areas of their lives.

Examples: For business-virtual offices, advertising, sale of goods, holding events, workplaces, concerts, training, etc. For individuals-entertainment, creation of territories, games, buildings, sale of goods and services, freelance, travel, excursions, training, etc.

Freelance example: In the metaverse, the user has the choice to create everything himself or order a service from a specialist. This applies to both objects and mechanics. At this moment, the internal freelance exchange also offers to use the service. The reward depends on the quality of the created content. Therefore, there is a direct relationship between the content being created, the customer and the performer of the work.

#### Detailed product description

NFT Moon Metaverse it is an implementation of an online gaming web service based on three.js and blockchain, as well as distributed IOT infrastructure. The service provides users with access to the functionality as a result of authorization using a crypto wallet. Within the framework of the service, the user can use the functionality of systems designed for the processes of creating and editing content, market processes of exchange, purchase and sale and others, financial processes, management processes, learning processes, communication processes and game and non-game interaction of users with each other, as well as with the surrounding virtual world and objects of the surrounding virtual world.
The main mechanics of user-product interaction are create-to-earn and play-to-earn.

Multi-blockchain bridge:

Multi-blockchain bridging is one of the most active areas of blockchain development at the moment, but few projects focus on NFT bridges. Even those that do support only a limited number of chains. The bridge in the NFT Moon Metaverse has the following advantages:

- The first bridge designed exclusively for NFTs, tackling every aspect of asset transition and compatibility across multiple protocols;
- A much wider range of supported blockchains: any chain can be connected to the bridge;
- Linking EVM to a range of non-EVM chains with fundamentally different tech stacks, such as Elrond, Solana, Cardano, Algorand, etc.
- A simple and seamless UI for minting, transfering, and exploring NFTs;
- Attractively low transaction fees, payable in the currency of the origin blockchain (ETH, BNB, SOL etc.);
- Highly scalable: the capacity of the bridge is limited only by the TPS of the bridged chains;
- Possibility to mint NFTs on multiple chains from an easy-to-use UI;
- Superior security and reliability: a multilayer security system capable of preventing all common types of attacks, with no single points of failure;
- A more versatile technological stack, and provide the same level of security and reliability;
- Possibility to integrate the bridge with any NFT dApp, allowing users to trade and exchange NFTs the way they are used to, while the bridge operates behind the scenes;
- Possibility of transferring NFTs in Batches;
- Possibility of transferring NFT smart contract logic;
- Option of choosing the smart contract to mint wrapped NFTs with on the target chain.

### Go-to-Market plan

We see several stages of growth of the project and Secret Network:

- Motivation of users who already have plots, id cards, avatars to use the bridge using the Secret Network. 
- Marketing activities: contests, rewards for using the Secret Network.
- Motivation of new users who buy plots, id cards, avatars - use Secret Network.
- We have a strategy for the B2B and B2C segment.  For B2B, this is an offer to companies to buy a location or a virtual office. For b2c, these are marketing events: bloggers and influencers, Ambassador programs, publication in major media and cross-marketing with major partners. Also negotiations with the stars for events inside the metaverse.
- Announcement of the Alpha version and subsequent seasons. Granting early access to those who have plots, id cards, avatars.
- Create the first 10 spaces of different themes.
- Partnership with major brands.
- Launch of a full-fledged marketplace for the sale of physical goods.
- Partnership with the developer of (VR/AR/XR) glasses for NFT Moon Metaverse.
